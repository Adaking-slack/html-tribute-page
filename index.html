                    <li>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</li>
                    <li>
                        Born December 10th 1815 to her parents poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron (who seperated a month after her birth) Ada was the only legitimate child of her parents
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    Ada Lovelace was educated privately by tutors and then self-educated but was helped  in her advanced studies by mathematician-logician Augustus De Morgan, the first professor of mathematics at the University of London.
                    </li>
                    <li>When she was 12, Lovelace decided she wanted to fly, and so decided to build herself some wings. She did this by researching different materials, studying birds and plan what materials she may need for her journey.</li>

                    <li>
                        Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer.                    </li>

                <li>
                    While some biographers, historians, and computer scientists have questioned the statement that Lovelace was the first programmer, her contributions to the development of the computer remain undisputed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ada Lovelace was the worlds first computer programmer; she began algorithm development back in the mid-nineteenth century. That’s over 150 years ago! This is especially remarkable because the first computer, Charles Babbage’s mechanical ‘Analytical Engine’, was still unfinished at the time.
                </li>

                <li>Lovelace also developed a vision of the capability of computers to do more than calculations and number crunching, although this was never realised in her lifetime.</li>
